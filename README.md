I found this looking for machine learning questions for Google<br>

someone in the comments said this cheetsheet helped them get the job https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html <br>

everyone says this free course is gold for preparing the inerview Andrew Ng's ML course youtube <br>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4kcAT0Y8Yg&t=106s first algorithm book, then grokking the coding interview course which is amazing, then leetcode, then whe used pramp website for mock interviews<br>

 advised in stevey's blog ranks: get that job at google (blog post advised to read by very google in the email mariel sent me: <br>
 - https://www.amazon.es/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693
 - introduction to algorithms
 - 'So ask. Ask if they care about syntax, and if they do, try to get it right. Look over your code carefully from different angles and distances. Pretend it's someone else's code and you're tasked with finding bugs in it. You'd be amazed at what you can miss when you're standing 2 feet from a whiteboard with an interviewer staring at your shoulder blades.'
 - practical concurrent programming book (i guess this is for cs fundamentals)
 -  other tips from google email https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/
 
- https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/?topics=machine-learning ml topics and interview prep by very google

in this video they cover https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/google/FMfcgzGpHHKCrHCRxsxCdlXhQHwkQQbg?projector=1 :
