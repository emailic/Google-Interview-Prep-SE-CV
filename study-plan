1. read initial chapters cracking the coding interview and research bibliography
(2 days)

2. ALGORITHMS AND DS:
- C0-C2 in EPI
- use CTCI as a guide for topics, but rely on Elements of Programming Interviews in Python for a more comprehensive and simpler explanation of the topics, moreover, an explanation pertinent to Python. 
- use Python IDE, solve as many exercises as possible, try to understand time and space complexity
- when done, revise the exercises u didn't understand and try to solve them now

3. NOTEBOOK & EXPLAINING (2 weeks or so)
- C3 in EPI
- Formalize your approach using the instructions from CTCI.
- Learn testing 
- Start coding in notebook while also explaining 
- Big O revision. Space analysis revision. 

4. ML part

5. FINAL REVISION AND MOCK INTERVIEWS (2-6 weeks BEFORE REACHING OUT TO THE RECRUITER):
- leetcode atope
- become a pro on time and space analysis
- Revision of topics
- PRAMP super important
- computer science fundamentals 

6. 2 WEEKS BEFORE INTERVIEW
- behavioural questions, mock interviews, revising previous topics
- re-read initial chapters of CTCI and elements of programming interviews in Python

To revise before the interview:
- examples and exercises in Big O chapter from CTCI
- inheritence, classes, instances, objects
- chapter 4  in Elements: primitive types: bitwise operators, masks, bit manipulations, signedness, shifting, cache..
