1. read initial chapters cracking the coding interview
2. ALGORITHMS AND DS:
-use CTCI as a guide for topics, but rely on Grokking Algorithms and Elements of Programming Interviews in Python for a more comprehensive and simpler explanation of the topics, moreover, an explanation pertinent to Python. 
-use Python IDE, solve as many exercises as possible, try to understand time and space complexity

3. Formalize your approach using the instructions from CTCI. Start coding in notebook while also explaining (2 weeks or so).

4. ML part

5. 2-4 weeks BEFORE REACHING OUT TO THE RECRUITER:
- leetcode atope. become a pro on time and space analysis. Revision of topics. testing.

6. MONTH before the first interview: behavioural questions, mock interviews, revising previous topics
- re-read initial chapters of CTCI and elements of programming interviews in Python

To revise before the interview:
- examples and exercises in Big O chapter from CTCI
- inheritence, classes, instances, objects
- chapter 4  in Elements: primitive types: bitwise operators, masks, bit manipulations, signedness, shifting, cache..
