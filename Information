# Google-Interview-Prep-SE-NLP
All you need in order to prepare for a Software Engineer NLP interview at Google

Mock interview Prep<br>
https://www.pramp.com/#/<br>

Algorithms and Data Structures Prep:

Google asseses you in 4 main areas:
<ol>
<li>-Coding ability </li>
<li>-Knowledge of data structures and algorithms </li>
<li>-Communication and Comprehension </li>
<li>-Coding efficacy</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
Coding: You are expected to know: APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, How to test your code, come up with corner and edge cases for the code.

I found this looking for machine learning questions for Google<br>

someone in the comments said this cheetsheet helped them get the job https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html <br>

ML summary quite useful: springboard.com/blog/data-science/machine-learning-interview-questions/ <br>

everyone says this free course is gold for preparing the inerview Andrew Ng's ML course youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU <br>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4kcAT0Y8Yg&t=106s first algorithm book, then grokking the coding interview course which is amazing, then leetcode, then whe used pramp website for mock interviews<br>

some basic ML formulas i might b asked at the int4erview https://blmoistawinde.github.io/ml_equations_latex/ <br>

 advised in stevey's blog ranks: get that job at google (blog post advised to read by very google in the email mariel sent me: <br>
 - https://www.amazon.es/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693
 - introduction to algorithms
 - 'So ask. Ask if they care about syntax, and if they do, try to get it right. Look over your code carefully from different angles and distances. Pretend it's someone else's code and you're tasked with finding bugs in it. You'd be amazed at what you can miss when you're standing 2 feet from a whiteboard with an interviewer staring at your shoulder blades.'
 - practical concurrent programming book (i guess this is for cs fundamentals)
 - Operating Systems: processes, threads and concurrency issues
 -  other tips from google email https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/
 
- https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/resources/?topics=machine-learning ml topics and interview prep by very google

in this video they cover https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/google/FMfcgzGpHHKCrHCRxsxCdlXhQHwkQQbg?projector=1 :
- communication and collaboration,
- algorithms and DS
- coding
- testing and error checking
- overall best practices

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs this guy says u don't need to know algorithms as much as u need to know data structures. grokking the coding interview provides you all the algorithm knowledge u need. he also says dont go into the interview focusing on the outcome, go witht he attitude: this is a learning opportunity and i get to talk to all these smart people and I get to learn from them. i'm here to learn. so instead of panicking and stressing when ur stuck u can say: hmm interesting u know i think im stuck here but do u have any ideas on where i could go from here or what i might have missed? interviewers love it when u ask them questions and they love a collaborative experience. in big tech communication is number one.<\br>
